BRICKS token holders can exercise influence over portfolio development, asset disposal, Active Participant (AP) selection, and diversification proposals via this innovative voting system, which operates on the “majority-rule” principle. Furthermore, the adaptable architecture of Bricklayer DAO enables a prompt reaction time to suggestions and contributions for the AP to action if the community’s general consensus determines that it would be substantially advantageous.",

Our goal is to establish the foundation for a DAO Treasury capable of self-sufficiency and ongoing expansion, consisting of a multi-tiered combination of high-quality real estate purchases and a pool of varied cryptocurrencies. This mitigates investor risk and creates a solid refinancing environment to facilitate further real estate investment without disposing of the DAO’s cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, the value of the connected BRICKS token will increase in tandem with the growth in the value of the DAO Treasury.",

For decades the working wage has not inflated at the same pace as real estate, thus contributing to multiple generations starting to embrace the blockchain industry because of the low-entry barrier and lucrative opportunities it presents. Nevertheless, one of the main points of apprehension to this nascent adoption is the frustration of market volatility. Bricklayer DAO has been built to limit this risk by avoiding the sudden steep declines and the now-famous TerraLuna and ‘Rug-Pull’ situations.",

Hence, this structure’s simplicity mitigates the negative effects of crypto-market volatility, fosters an atmosphere conducive to refinancing, and supports the value of BRICKS tokens.",

E-commerce saw a year-over-year growth rate that skyrocketed to 44.5 % in 2021 (Jdsupra, 2022). According to the findings of CBRE Research, an increase of one billion dollars in additional e-commerce sales results in need for one quarter of a million square feet of warehouse space. As a result, it is anticipated that the net absorption in North America will reach close to 250 million square feet in 2021, which will be higher than the five-year annual average of 211 million square feet that was recorded before (CBRE, 2021).",
